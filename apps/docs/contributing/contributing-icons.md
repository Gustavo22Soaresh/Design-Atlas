# Contributing icons 

**Atlas** uses the [**Material Symbols**](https://fonts.google.com/icons) library as the official foundation for its icon set. This choice was made due to the wide range of consistent, accessible, and well-documented symbols, developed and maintained by Google. The icons follow the design principles of [Material Design](https://m3.material.io/), which emphasize simple shapes, legibility at various sizes, visual clarity, and adaptability across international contexts.

All icons are vector-based, scalable, and optimized for high-resolution displays. Atlas primarily adopts the [**Rounded**](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&icon.style=Rounded) style, which offers a balance between visual lightness and recognizability. However, other styles such as [**Outlined**](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&icon.style=Outlined), [**Sharp**](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&icon.style=Sharp), or [**Filled**](https://fonts.google.com/icons?icon.set=Material+Symbols&icon.style=Filled) may also be used depending on contrast, visual weight, or functional context.

The library supports CSS customization (such as color, size, and weight), making it easy to apply in responsive interfaces and reusable components like buttons, menus, or status indicators.

Using Material Symbols also ensures automatic support for reading directions (LTR and RTL), improving accessibility and internationalization. All icons used in Atlas are available in the [official Figma community file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1035203688168086460) and can be referenced directly by developers via symbol codes in [optimized SVG format](https://github.com/google/material-design-icons).
