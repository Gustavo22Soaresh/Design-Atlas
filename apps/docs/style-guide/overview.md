# Overview

**Atlas Design Style Guide**, **currently in development**, aims to **unify and modernize the user experience** across all platforms. It was designed to meet community needs, promoting **consistency, accessibility, and scalability**.

These principles and guidelines help designers and developers with their [OSM](http://osm.org/) projects.

## Our Process

**Atlas** is maintained through a collaborative effort between the **[University of Brasília (UnB)](https://unb.br), [Federal University of Espírito Santo (UFES)](https://ufes.br/)**. Our team consists of **passionate designers and developers** dedicated to this initiative.

Our focus is on **user experience design, user research, and development**.

**Open to Participation**

We warmly encourage and welcome your **[collaboration and participation](../contributing/overview.md)** to evolve the design system. Our goal is to replicate **OSM's core philosophy**, being **open and collaborative**.
