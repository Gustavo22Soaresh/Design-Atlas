# Design tokens

**Design tokens are the smallest stylistic pieces of our design system**.

We use tokens:
- To maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for user-interface (UI) development in a
  single source of truth instead of hard-coded style values or single-use variables
- To ensure that only systematic decisions are used to style components and features

Tokens can be used in several formats: CSS custom properties, Less variables, SCSS variables,
ES6 variables and JSON files.

Each token category has a demo page where you can check each token's name and value, a demo of the
token, and information about where the token value comes from.

## Using design tokens

### Figma

Enable the [Atlas Figma library](https://www.figma.com/design/2vheURjyvYg2oyBeuQOxQ1/%F0%9F%92%A0-Atlas---Design-System?m=auto&t=zXhsNI5KObVWIEyg-1) to reuse all the design tokens that were translated into Figma styles and variables.

### NPM package

See the [installation](../using-atlas/usage.md#installation) and [using design tokens](../using-atlas/usage.md#using-design-tokens) documentation for information about how to use Atlas design tokens in your application.
