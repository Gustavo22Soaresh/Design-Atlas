### Can I request a feature?

You are welcome to create new Issue on the [**Atlas**](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/tag/Atlas/) Phabricator workboard. New Issue will go into our "Inbox" column and will be triaged regularly. Please remember
that Atlas is maintained by a nonprofitâ€”we won't be able to meet all feature requests, and it might
take time to get to your request.

Please use the Issue templates for each type of request:

- [New token](https://github.com/Gustavo22Soaresh/Design-Atlas/issues/new?template=add-new--name--token-in-atlas.md)

### How can I contribute to a task?

Create or claim a task as soon as you decide to work on it. This will help avoid overlapping,
duplicate, or conflicting work. If you're creating a task, add as much detail as you can about the
scope of the task: for example, what needs to be completed before the task can be considered "done"?
