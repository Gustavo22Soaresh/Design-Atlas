# Reporting and validating

## File a Issue

If the Issue doesn’t already exist in the [Project board](https://github.com/users/Gustavo22Soaresh/projects/8), create one using one of the following Issue templates, making sure to file in as much information as possible in the predefined sections:

- [New component](https://github.com/Gustavo22Soaresh/Design-Atlas/issues/new?template=-componentname---add--componentname--component-to-atlas.md): Use this Issue template if you're proposing a new component that doesn't yet exist in Atlas. Only the MVP version of the component will be built initially, with future features handled in separate Issues.
- [Update an existing component](https://github.com/Gustavo22Soaresh/Design-Atlas/issues/new?template=update--componentname--component-in-atlas.md): Use this Issue template to propose updates to an existing Atlas component, such as adding a new property or variant, refining its visual style, or improving its behavior.

## Create an inventory

Create an initial inventory with the relevant use cases where this component will be reused. You can check the following resources to collect relevant information:

- [Atlas component demos](../components/overview.md): verify whether the needed component has already been implemented, or whether it can be designed based on any of the existing ones. Make sure to compare components in the same category or with similar characteristics that could influence the approach.

## Validate the Issue
