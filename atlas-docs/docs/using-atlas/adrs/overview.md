# Architecture Decision Records

An architecture decision record (ADR) documents an important software design decision by explaining the context and consequences of the decision.

The ADRs in this repo follow [this template](https://github.com/Gustavo22Soaresh/Design-Atlas/blob/main/atlas-docs/docs/using-atlas/adrs/NNNN-adr-template.md).

For convenience a [template file](./NNNN-adr-template.md) is provided in this folder. When writing a new ADR copy the template and start from there.
