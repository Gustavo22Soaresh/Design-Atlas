# Components

**Components are the interactive building blocks of our design system.** They are used to create
consistent and powerful user interfaces.

The Codex library contains two types of components:

1. Fully interactive components built with [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/). These components require
Vue 3 and JavaScript.
2. CSS-only components that consist either of styles with suggested markup (e.g. the
[CSS-only Button](./demos/button.md#css-only-version)) or a Less mixin (e.g.
[Link](./mixins/link.md)). Most of the Vue components have a corresponding CSS-only version. These
components can be used without JavaScript.

Each component in Codex has a demo page where you can interact with working examples, check code samples, and read detailed usage information about the Vue and CSS-only implementations.
