A ButtonGroup consists of a set of two or more normal buttons. Buttons in such a group signal a number of equally important actions that will occur when the user taps on them.

## Overview

### When to use ButtonGroup

Use the ButtonGroup component when you want users to choose actions from a set of actions, with the restriction that only one can be active at a time. If you want to enable users to select one or multiple options from a set of options, use ToggleButtonGroup instead.*.*

### About ButtonGroup

ButtonGroup consists of a minimum of two neutral normal Buttons, which include the following elements.

#### Label
Each button within the ButtonGroup must have a label. Button labels should be as short as possible, with text that clearly states what action will be taken once the button is pressed (e.g. download, submit form, search).*.*

* **Do:** Customize the content of each button, allowing for superscript, subscript, or special characters.  
* **Do:** Use numbers instead of text if needed  
* **Don't:** Highlight what users should avoid when using this element.

#### Icon (optional)
Icons simplify user recognition and provide the ability to shorten button labels to a minimum.

* **Do:** Mix text-only and icon-only buttons exclusively when using the ‘ellipsis‘ icon to indicate additional actions.  
* **Don't:** In order to ensure consistency, avoid mixing different types of button contents within the same ButtonGroup.

## Examples

### Basic usage

### With icon

Use an icon with the button label when you need to convey meaning through both textual and visual elements.

### Icon-only buttons

For icon-only buttons, the label will be visually hidden and available only to users of assistive technology.

* **Do:** Icon-only buttons may be used to form a ButtonGroup but only if the icons used are universally understood and do not require accompanying text.

### Icon-only buttons

When the ButtonGroup is too large to fit on one line, the buttons overflow to the next line.
